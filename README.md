# Online-shopping-predictor
Machine learning model to predict whether online shopping customers will complete a purchase

Analyzed various information about users in a session, such as types of pages users have visited in the
session(Administrative, Product Related, etc), how close the date of the user’s session is to a special day (like
Valentine’s Day or Mother’s Day), how much time the user spent on any of those pages, etc

Trained a nearest neighbour classifier and Multilayer Perceptron with that data, having an accuracy of 91% for users who did not make a
purchase and 60% for users who made a purchase
